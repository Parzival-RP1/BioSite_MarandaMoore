                <h1>quick intro</h1>
                <h2>I was born in Arkansas, 1978. I grew up in small town in NW Arkansas but I eventually moved to Washington DC, where I worked as a nanny for a few years. Moved back home to Arkansas . When I was 30 I went back to college (for the first time) to pursue a degree in graphic design. Made a lot of friends along the way and found out a lot about what I am passionate about. If you like amazing adventures, then we have that in common. Scroll down the old-fashioned way, or click some of the links up top to jump to different sections.</h2>

                <h1>hiking</h1>
                <h2>Another passion of mine is hiking. Not just hiking, but backpacking and camping. Any chance I get, I am out on the trail and hopefully hanging around a camp-fire. One of my favorite hiking trips was to Havasu Falls in Arizona. The hike through the desert was brutal, but worth it when I got to the amazing water falls, it was so rewarding! I also don’t use a tent; my recommendation is hammock-camping!</h2>

                <h1>Cycling</h1>
                <h2>Another one of my favorite things to do is cycling. I may have a bum hip or as I like to call it - my “old lady hip”. But it doesn’t stop me from riding every chance I get. The furthest I’ve gone on one ride is 100 miles. I don’t compete or anything, mostly just ride for fun.</h2>
