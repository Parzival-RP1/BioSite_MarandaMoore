                <h1>quick intro</h1>
                <h2>I was born in Arkansas, 1978. I grew up in small town in Northwest Arkansas but I eventually moved to Washington DC, where I worked as a nanny for a few years. I moved back home to Arkansas when I was 30 and decided to go to college to pursue a degree in graphic design. I've made a lot of friends along the way and found out a lot about what I am passionate about. If you like amazing adventures, then we have that in common.</h2>

                <h1>hiking</h1>
                <h2>One of my passions is hiking, not just hiking though but backpacking and camping. Any chance I get, I am out on the trail and hopefully hanging around a camp-fire. One of my favorite hiking trips was to Havasu Falls in Arizona. The hike through the desert was brutal, but worth it when I got to the amazing water falls, it was so rewarding! I also don’t use a tent; my recommendation is hammock-camping!</h2>

                <h1>Cycling</h1>
                <h2>Another one of my favorite things to do is cycling. I may have a bum hip or as I like to call it - my “old lady hip”. But it doesn’t stop me from riding every chance I get. The furthest I’ve gone on one ride is 100 miles. I don’t compete or anything, mostly just ride for the thrill of it.</h2>

                <h2>When I’m not on the trail or on my bike…or my couch…chances are I am on the water kayaking and enjoying a tasty beverage. There is nothing quite like a cold beer while floating down the Buffalo River. I have also taken my camping gear with me a few times to camping along the river, which I highly recommend if you haven't done it before.</h2>

                <h2>I never claimed that during my adventures, that I did any of it with grace. I drop my phone more than anyone I know, which means I’ve had to replace far too many screens…I’ve even learned how to replace the glass on my own phone. That wont stop me from continuing to be adventurous, and clumsy.</h2>
